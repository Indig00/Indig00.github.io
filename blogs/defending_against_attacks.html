<h1>Defending against cyber attacks</h1>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_small">Over the course of this blog post, I shall be talking about the different methods that you use to attempt to prevent cyber attacks. These methods include:</p>
<ul class="cyber_attack_list">
<li>Antivirus and Anti spyware</li>
<li>WEP/WPA Keys</li>
<li>Firewalls, DMZ and Static Ips</li>
<li>Honeypots</li>
<li>Different Authentication mechanisms</li> 
<li>Different access permissions</li>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Monitoring the network</li>
<li>Penetration Testing</li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_small">I shall also be talking about these 2 methods in order to identify when an attack is taking place on a network: </p>
<ul class="cyber_attack_list">
<li>IPS (Intrusion prevention system)</li>
<li>IDS (Intrusion detection system)</li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">I'm going to start off by talking about anti-virus's and anti spyware softwares. These pieces of software scan a piece of software once it is opened are scanned; once these files are scanned the code is compared to code that's stored in a database. If code is found that's similar to code that's in the database, the executable will be terminated and moved into a "quarentine" where it can either be restored and exectued again, making it immune from the anti-virus software/anti-malware software; or you can delete it and it'll be gone from your system. These pieces of software are highly effective, however considering that hackers come up with new ways to write malicious code; it doesn't work 100 percent of the time.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">WEP/WPA keys are another word for authentication to a network. These "keys" are actually strings that are made up of letters and numbers and are usually found on the back of routers provided by internet providers such as Plusnet and Sky. These "keys" are required in order to gain access to the network; this is a highly effective way of authentication considering that these keys are usually up to 15-20 characters long and consist of a number of different letters and numbers; meaning that it'd take a while to crack someones wifi password. WPA stands for WiFi Protected Security and is the mordern day standard for the encrpytion of data that's being exchanged over a WiFi network. WEP however stands for Wired Equivilent Privacy; although it's a form of encryption for data over a network; it's easy to crack and the least secure way of securing a network; it's recommended to use WPA/WPA2.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">A firewall is a wall that's created between your computer and the network; you can choose what programs are allowed to connect to the internet, as well as what programs are allowed to rceieve packets from the internet. Firewalls also allow for ports to be opened; when a port is "opened" for either in-going or out-going traffic, it'll allow for packets to be sent to them ports. Port opening is a practise that's usually used for online gaming services; due to the server listening for players inputs on 1 outgoing port, and then sending that data back to the player through the listening port. A DMZ is called a "Demiliterised Zone" any devices that are placed within this zone can access the internet in an unrestricted fashion, meaning that any blockages that an orginisation might put in (the blocking of spesific ports/webpages for example) Aren't applicable within this zone. Servers are commonly placed within this zone, so that users that are a part of the LAN can request packets from the internet, the server checks the request over to make sure that it's safe and then sends the packets back over to the machine within the LAN. DMZ's are used in order to prevent a potentional attacker from gaining easy access to a LAN; having a DMZ means that a hacker would first have to break into a device with high permissions that's located within the DMZ zone and then access the LAN that way. Finally; I shall be talking about static IP addresses, static IP addresses are usually used on a LAN in order to identify devices easily. If an IP address is static it means that it won't chnage no matter the circumstance. Due to this; they're not commonly used outside of LANs due to their lack of security, if an attacker found out the IP address of someone with a static IP, they'd be able to keep you online for as a long as they wanted by preforming a DOS/DDOS attack depending on the size of the network, and considering that your IP address is static it won't stop until you contact your ISP asking for a new one. </p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">A honeypot is a decoy that's setup on a network, they're setup as a decoy to lure attackers into attacking them and then once they're attacked, they'll detect that they're being attacked and study the attempt that's taking place; they're usually used by big companies to see how attackers are attempting to hack their servers and get a better knowlage of what potentional vunrabilities they could have in their systems. These honeypots usually pose as high value targets such as media servers and DNS's. The problem with honeypots being that if they're not configured correctly; they can be used to take control of real systems within the network.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_small">There's 4 different authentication mechanisms when it comes to signing into a network: </p>
<ul class="cyber_attack_list">
<li>Password Authentication</li>
<li>Two Factor Authentication (2FA)</li>
<li>Token Authentication (cards, USB sticks)</li>
<li>Biometric Authentication</li>
</ul>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Starting off with password authentication; this is the most standard and most used authentication method for basically anything, from your computer to logging into your social medias. This authentication method will ask the user for a "password" the first time they sign up to a service that'll be used eveytime that they sign in. Once entered, the password will go through a set algorithm that generates a password "hash" Then, everytime the user signs in the user will be asked for their password which will be hashed and compared to the hash that's kept for that user in a database, if the hash is correct the user will be signed in, else they'll be prompted that their password is incorrect. This method of authentication is vunrable to bruteforcing; which is the method of trying 100,000's of different password combinations. Due to this, users are usually recommended to add special characters such as @, $, ! etc to their passwords to make them harder to bruteforce/manually guess.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Two factor authentication is another widely used Authentication mechanism, this mechanism asks the user for something else as well as their password. A common example would be a bank asking for your PIN at an ATM machine, or when you go to sign into online banking you're asked for 3 digits of your phrase that you set when you signed up for your bank. Other services such as the online gaming network known as "Steam" uses an app that you can download onto your phone and everytime that you login to your account you're asked to give the 4 digit code that's displayed on the app. 2FA is quite an effective form authentication mechanism, as it's quite hard to break without social engineering or shouldering which might not be possible if you don't have enough information on the person that you're attempting to hack.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Token authentication is authentication that uses a physical device/card such as a smart card or a USB device in order to authenticate a user into a system. This is an extremely effective method for as long as the devices don't get lost/stolen, as then they can fall into the wrong hands and could be cloned or even used as they are in order to gain unauthorised access into a system.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Biometric Authentication is using physical features such as finger print sensors, facial recognision, retina scans and voice recognision; in order to authenticate a user into a system/device. This method is commonly used in mobile devices so they can be accessed quickly, as well as being secure. The downside being that these systems tend to be very expensive considering that they require specialist hardware in order to work, the other issue being is that people worry about privacy considering that these devices have to store your bioemtric data on them in order to work; meaning that data could be shared with 3rd party orginisations without knowlage.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Next, I'll be talking about different access permissions. These are important to have in orginisations; as not every user needs to have root accees and be able to read and write every single file. Usually a users access is dependent on how high up in a company they are, for example if you're just an employee that works there as an office worker to read emails and write reports; then you're only going to be able to read and write files onto a server that stores them reports. Access permissions also change what's visable and what applications can be opened. For example, a standard user might not be able to see the C drive so that they're not able to delete core system files and sabotage the buisness and then programs such as CMD will be blocked so that malicous batchfiles cannot be run. In short; different access premissions are used to prevent users from doing something malicious. </p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Encryption is used in order to prevent users that aren't authorized viewing data. Encrypted data tends to be very confidential and extremly important considering that any data that's encrypted takes a long time in order to access due to both the public and private key for that file having to be processed in order for it to be opened. However; a mathmatical attack would be required in order to guess the private key for the file, meaning that it'd be extremely hard for an attacker to actually gain anything other than the encrypted file that won't show any information.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Monitoring a network manually is an effective but time consuming method to prevent a cyber attack. However; when monitored with either an IPS or an IDS; or depending on the size of the company both, they're highly effective and automaited ways of preventing an attacker from gaining unauthorized access to a network. An IPS will usually act upon what an IDS has told it, or might even have an IDS built into it. An IPs will quite simpily block supicious activity on a network and then an IDS will detect that initial suspisious activity. So for example; if a company that's based in the united states and only has employee's from the united states has one of their admin panels constantly being failed to be logged into by an IP address in russia, the IDS will flag that as suspisious activity due to the geolocation of the IP address and the activity that's taking place, then the IPS will block that IP address from accessing the login page.</p>
<p class="blog_paragraphs_large">Finally, a Penetration test is hiring a white hat hacker to break into your system. They'll be given a certian amount of information about the company, and then be expected to break into the system. If the white hat hacker is successful, they'll tell the company how they were able to break in. This quite commonly is a highly effective method of preventing cyber-attacks, as you've got a professional that might want to look into breaking into your company doing it for you and then telling you how they did it. However this is a very expensive method of prevenetion considering that the average white hat hacker can charge up to £25,000+ depending on the size of the company. Companies might also put up advertisements on sites such as "HackerOne" for aspiring hackers and white-hats (and sometimes; even black-hat) To break into companies, and then offer a cash reward if they're able to break in and email how they were able to do it. Some of these "bounties" that have been placed on sites such as hackerone have even lead to job opertunities within that company.</p>
